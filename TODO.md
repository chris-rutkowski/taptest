TODO:
- ci prevent outdated codegen
- driver tests
- analytics
- snapshots to have device name attached [device]
- readme
- check all samples
- retry
- consider snapshot on failure
- snapshots to be in global directory, currently test in folder will create another golden path
- use configurable logger https://pub.dev/packages/logger instead of printing
- StackTrace print('this is platform ${StackTrace.current.toString()}'); can help creating path for goldens
- ability to provide keys to be awaited disappearance during snapshot tests
- action to go - navigating using router, testing deeplinks etc
- MockHttpRequestHandler doesn't need path if the uri can be uri.path
- Info in wait about gesture detector
- maybe test detect timers in progress and wait for all of them - configurable
- make nav test using ordinary Navigator 2.0 not only GoRouter
- make some mini package with start app Params - location theme as well as initial route
- consider initial route as a '/' instead of null
- go action clearly uses the api inappropriately - should be fixed
- precache all images from the assets
- quick navigation integration test has some trouble in Spanish locale
-     debugDumpApp();
